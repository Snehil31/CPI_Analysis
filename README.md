Title: India CPI Inflation Case Study

Overview: CPI stands for Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services over time.

In India, CPI is used to measure inflation, and it involves a fixed basket of goods and services. This basket is comprehensive and includes a wide array of items that an average Indian consumer uses. These items are not limited to just food and clothing but extend to transportation, medical care, electricity, education, and almost every other category that involves expenditure of money. The CPI is calculated by comparing the general price level in the markets during a particular time period with a base year. The items in the CPI basket are classified across various categories like food and beverages, clothing, housing, fuel and light, and recreation, among others.

The CPI basket contains categories like food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, and more. The weight of each category in the total index might differ based on its relative importance to the average consumer expenditure but for the purpose of this analysis consider equal weights across all categories.

Note: In this case study, I have used average values for replacing the outliers and the null values.
